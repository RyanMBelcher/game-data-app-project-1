# Game Data App Project

## This is the official README file for the Video Game Generator App. 

## Description

- Our motivation for building this project is giving gamers an outlet to find a game that they love. 
- We created the app so that rather than endlessly searching through several amount of games for one to play, we can have one simply picked for us.  
- With this app, we hope to solve the problem that gamers have faced since the beginning of gaming... Picking which game to play.
- During the creation of this project we have learned different things about creating a webpage such as adapting to changes and learning how to manage a mass amount of data but one of the most important things we have learned is teamwork, it really does make the dream work...

To use the app/website, it is as simple as going to the website, selecting the genre and platform you want to play from the dropdown selections, clicking generate, and having your randomly reccommended game generated and displayed to you on the page. 

## Usage

Open the application/URL on your desired browser and desired device. Use the drop down menus for console and genre to select certain field requirements for your randmoly generated game. Click the generate button and a game title will appear, and do not worry! The game title will still be there if you click out of the page and decide to come back. View the three lists to see highest rated games of the year, the most popular games of the year, and the best current deals on HumbleBundle. Also, feel free to check out our game of the day!
