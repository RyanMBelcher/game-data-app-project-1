# Game Data App Project

## This is the official README file for the Video Game Generator App. 

## Description

- Our motivation for building this project is giving gamers an outlet to find a game that they love. 
- We created the app so that rather than endlessly searching through several amount of games for one to play, we can have one simply picked for us.  
- With this app, we hope to solve the problem that gamers have faced since the beginning of gaming... Picking which game to play.
- During the creation of this project we have learned different things about creating a webpage such as adapting to changes and learning how to manage a mass amount of data but one of the most important things we have learned is teamwork, it really does make the dream work...
